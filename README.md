## Welcome to the Railfrog Reference Application

### Requirements

Railfrog setup currently requires the commandline - on Windows, Start | Accessories | All Programs | Command Shell, or
use Terminal or Konsole on OS/X / Linux.

You need to have the following:

  1. Ruby interpreter. See http://www.ruby-lang.org
  2. RubyGems. See http://www.rubygems.org 
  3. Rails. Run `gem install rails` (or `sudo gem install rails` on Linux or OS/X)  
  (**Note:** No longer required for Git installation - see below)
  4. SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL. Find full list of supported databases at
  <http://api.rubyonrails.com/files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html> -SQLite has the easiest setup
  and may already be installed.
  5. The mime-types gem:
   - `gem install mime-types`


### Installation

 * Grab our empty Rails 2.0 application with installed Railfrog:

   * If you have Git - clone the railfrog repo, then get linked resources (including Rails):


    git clone git://github.com/railfrog/railfrog.git
    git submodule update --init


   * If you prefer just to download - you'll need to install Rails.

Note:  currently Railfrog only works with Rails 2.0 and earlier. This is automatically
handled by the Git installation. 

   * download as a zip - <http://github.com/railfrog/railfrog/zipball/master>
   * download as a tarball - <http://github.com/railfrog/railfrog/tarball/master>

 Edit config/database.yml if you want to use MySQL or PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.

 * Set up the database. **Note:** For the current Rails 2.0.5 code you'll need Rake 0.7.3 installed.

    sudo gem i --version=0.7.3 rake
    rake _0.7.3_ db:migrate


### Getting Started

 * Change to the directory where Railfrog is unpacked, e.g. C:\apps\railfrog
Start service by running script/server and open http://localhost:3000/admin

Opening http://localhost:3000/ shows a "404 Page Not Found" error, which is correct since you haven't configured a site yet.

See the [wiki docs](http://wiki.github.com/railfrog/railfrog) for instructions on setting up your new site.
